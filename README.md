Please message me with any corrections.

Diode values not known - except the two zenner's that were un-soldered and checked.

BR1 bridge rectifier was broken ( replaced ) - not rectifying - sine wave pass-through

C15 was shorted - replaced

I tripped our house RCD several times when connecting a DSOShell oscilloscope UART to USB ! 
https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/224824/why-did-my-oscilloscope-hookup-trip-my-rcd

I blew the pcb fuse with a big BANG and spark when forgetting to disconnect the oscilloscope 
UART to USB when taking a reading on the transformer primary side.

On +5V output my DMM reads 6.5V (1MΩ input resistance)
with 2.7Ω 7W power resistor between Common and +5V; reads as +5.2V

Please be careful with mains power.
